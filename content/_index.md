        # Recommendation systems
        Recommendation systems (RS) are technologies that utilize user behavior and content characteristics to predict user preferences and provide personalized recommendations, which are widely used in fields such as e-commerce and social media.

        We are committed to researching trustworthy RS, the theory of RS, and large language models (LLMs) for RS. Our work has been published in numerous top conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, AAAI, KDD, WWW, SIGIR, WSDM, CIKM, Recsys, and TOIS.

        # Graph mining

        Graph data mining aims to extract the underlying relationships and patterns between entities from various graph-structured data, which has many real-world applications such as social network analysis, bioinformatics and financial fraud detection. 

        We are committed to researching Graph Transformer, Graph Structure Learning, Graph Query Answering and Knowledge Graph Learning. Our work has been published in numerous top conferences, including NeurIPS, WWW, SIGIR, WSDM, CIKM, and ICDE

        # Diffusion Models
        Diffusion Models are a class of generative models that have gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. By establishing a mapping from noise distribution to data distribution, Diffusion Models can generate high-quality data such as images, videos, audios and text.

        We are devoted to provide a deeper understanding of the generation dynamics of Diffusion Models and the acceleration of their sampling processes. Our works have been published in top conferences such as CVPR, ICML and NeurIPS.

        # Knowledge Distillation
        
        Knowledge distillation aims to achieve efficient transfer of knowledge from complex models to lightweight models. The goal is to balance the inference cost and performance of compact models, facilitating the deployment of intelligent models in resource-constrained scenarios such as edge computing and mobile devices.
