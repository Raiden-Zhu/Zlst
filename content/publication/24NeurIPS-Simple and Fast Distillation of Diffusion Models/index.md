abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated their powerful performance across various tasks, but this comes at a cost of the slow sampling speed. To achieve both efficient and high-quality synthesis, various distillation-based accelerated sampling methods have been developed recently. However, they generally require time-consuming fine tuning with elaborate designs to achieve satisfactory performance in a specific number of function evaluation (NFE), making them difficult to employ in practice. To address this issue, we propose Simple and Fast Distillation (SFD) of diffusion models, which simplifies the paradigm used in existing methods and largely shortens their fine-tuning time up to 1000Ã—. We begin with a vanilla distillation-based sampling method and boost its performance to state of the art by identifying and addressing several small yet vital factors affecting the synthesis efficiency and quality. Our method can also achieve sampling with variable NFEs using a single distilled model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFD strikes a good balance between the sample quality and fine-tuning costs in few-step image generation task. For example, SFD achieves 4.53 FID (NFE=2) on CIFAR-10 with only 0.64 hours of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Our code is available at https://github.com/zju-pi/diff-sampler.
