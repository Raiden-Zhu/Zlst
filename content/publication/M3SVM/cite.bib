# 英文摘要
abstract: 'Ensemble clustering has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing heterogeneous and complex data. Despite the abundance of existing schemes, co-association matrix-based methods remain the mainstream approach. However, focusing solely on pairwise correlations falls short of fully capturing the intricate cluster relationships. Moreover, despite its potential, ensemble clustering has yet to effectively leverage the powerful representation capabilities of neural networks. To address these limitations, we propose a deep ensemble clustering method called Ensemble Clustering with Attentional Representation (ECAR). Our method considers the results of base partitions as groups with related information to explore higher-order fusion information. ECAR captures the importance of each sample’s association with its related group by employing an attentional network, and encodes this information into a low-dimensional representation. The attentional network is trained by jointly optimizing the clustering loss from soft assignments learned from the embeddings and the reconstruction loss from the weighted graph generated from ensemble clustering. During training, the weights of base partitions are adaptively refined to promote diversity and consistency while reducing the impact of low-quality and redundant base partitions. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the substantial improvement of our method over existing baseline ensemble clustering methods and deep clustering methods.'

# 英文摘要
abstract: 'Support Vector Machine (SVM) stands out as a prominent machine learning technique widely applied in practical pattern recognition tasks. It achieves binary classification by maximizing the "margin", which represents the minimum distance between instances and the decision boundary. Although many efforts have been dedicated to expanding SVM for multi-class case through strategies such as one versus one and one versus the rest, satisfactory solutions remain to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-class SVM that incorporates pairwise class loss considerations and maximizes the minimum margin. Adhering to this concept, we embrace a new formulation that imparts heightened flexibility to multi-class SVM. Furthermore, the correlations between the proposed method and multiple forms of multi-class SVM are analyzed. The proposed regularizer, akin to the concept of "margin", can serve as a seamless enhancement over the softmax in deep learning, providing guidance for network parameter learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method over existing multi-classification methods.

# 英文摘要
abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for analyzing graph data on the web and beyond. Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised paradigm, not only mitigates reliance on annotations but also has potential in performance. The hard negative sampling strategy that benefits CL in other domains proves ineffective in the context of Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) due to the message passing mechanism. Embracing the subspace hypothesis in clustering, we propose a method towards expansive and adaptive hard negative mining, referred to as G raph contR astive leA rning via subsP ace prE serving (GRAPE ). Beyond homophily, we argue that false negatives are prevalent over an expansive range and exploring them confers benefits upon GCL. Diverging from existing neighbor-based methods, our method seeks to mine long-range hard negatives throughout subspace, where message passing is conceived as interactions between subspaces. %Empirical investigations back up this strategy. Additionally, our method adaptively scales the hard negatives set through subspace preservation during training. In practice, we develop two schemes to enhance GCL that are pluggable into existing GCL frameworks. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed and the connections to related methods are investigated. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms across diverse graph datasets and remains competitive across varied application scenarios\footnoteOur code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/WWW24-GRAPE.'
