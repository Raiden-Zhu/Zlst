# 英文摘要
abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for analyzing graph data on the web and beyond. Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised paradigm, not only mitigates reliance on annotations but also has potential in performance. The hard negative sampling strategy that benefits CL in other domains proves ineffective in the context of Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) due to the message passing mechanism. Embracing the subspace hypothesis in clustering, we propose a method towards expansive and adaptive hard negative mining, referred to as G raph contR astive leA rning via subsP ace prE serving (GRAPE ). Beyond homophily, we argue that false negatives are prevalent over an expansive range and exploring them confers benefits upon GCL. Diverging from existing neighbor-based methods, our method seeks to mine long-range hard negatives throughout subspace, where message passing is conceived as interactions between subspaces. %Empirical investigations back up this strategy. Additionally, our method adaptively scales the hard negatives set through subspace preservation during training. In practice, we develop two schemes to enhance GCL that are pluggable into existing GCL frameworks. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed and the connections to related methods are investigated. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms across diverse graph datasets and remains competitive across varied application scenarios\footnoteOur code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/WWW24-GRAPE.'
